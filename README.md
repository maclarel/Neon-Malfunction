# **Neon Malfunction**

## **Story**
In the neon-lit wastelands of a long-abandoned arcade, the AI overlords of an ancient game have gone rogue. Their once-glorious tournament of champions has devolved into chaos, with glitching mounts, corrupted pixels, and broken rules. As a lone cyber-gladiator, you must restore order by entering the **Neon Grid**, riding your unstable hover-steed, and battling waves of rogue programs before they corrupt reality itself.

Can you outfly the glitches and survive the **Neon Malfunction**?

## **How to Play**

### **Controls**
- **Flap (Jump/Ascend):** Press (Spacebar) to gain altitude.
- **Move Left/Right:** Use (A/D keys) to navigate.
- **Land on Enemies:** Collide with enemies from above to defeat them.
- **Collect Data Shards:** Absorb digital fragments to increase score and stability.

### **Game Rules**
- **High Ground Wins:** Just like Joust, attacking from a higher position eliminates enemies.
- **Beware the Glitches:** Some enemies will behave unpredictablyâ€”watch for erratic movements.
- **Neon Corruption Spreads:** The longer you play, the more unstable the world becomesâ€”platforms may disappear!
- **Eliminate All Opponents:** Clear all enemies to complete a wave.
