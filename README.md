# **Neon Malfunction**

## **Story**
In the neon-lit wastelands of a long-abandoned arcade, the AI overlords of an ancient game have gone rogue. Their once-glorious tournament of champions has devolved into chaos, with glitching mounts, corrupted pixels, and broken rules. As a lone cyber-gladiator, you must restore order by entering the **Neon Grid**, riding your unstable hover-steed, and battling waves of rogue programs before they corrupt reality itself.

Can you outfly the glitches and survive the **Neon Malfunction**?

## **How to Play**

### **Controls**
- **Flap (Jump/Ascend):** Press (Spacebar) to gain altitude.
- **Move Left/Right:** Use (A/D keys) to navigate.
- **Land on Enemies:** Collide with enemies from above to defeat them.
- **Collect Data Shards:** Absorb digital fragments to increase score and stability. Each Data Shard is worth 2 points.

### **Game Rules**
- **High Ground Wins:** Just like Joust, attacking from a higher position eliminates enemies.
- **Beware the Glitches:** Some enemies will behave unpredictablyâ€”watch for erratic movements.
- **Neon Corruption Spreads:** The longer you play, the more unstable the world becomesâ€”platforms may disappear!
- **Eliminate All Opponents:** Clear all enemies to complete a wave.
- **Boundary Collision Ends Game:** If the player touches the boundaries of the game window, the game will end.
- **Game Over Screen:** When the game ends, a Game Over screen will be displayed showing the final score and an option to play again or quit by pressing Q.
- **Data Shards Points:** Each Data Shard collected is worth 2 points.
- **Enemies Points:** Each enemy defeated is worth 10 points.
- **Level Up Feature:** When the player has collided with all Enemy objects, an interstitial screen will be displayed outlining the current score and prompting the user to press "N" to advance to the next level. The game will restart with the player's current score as a starting point and the number of enemies will increase by 20% (with a minimum increase of 1).

### **Player Controls and Collision Detection**
- **Continuous Movement:** The player can move continuously by holding down the A/D keys.
- **Collision Detection:** The player will collide with platforms and neon grid elements, updating their position accordingly.

### **Spawning the Player Character**
- The player character is automatically spawned at the center of the screen when the game starts.
